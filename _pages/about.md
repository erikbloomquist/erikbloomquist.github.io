My name is Erik Bloomquist, and I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ufl.edu//) at the University of Florida. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, probability, and machine learning. I'm especially drawn to problems involving interpretability, robustness, and theoretical foundations of ML algorithms.

I currently work as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Florida Institute for National Security](https://fins.institute.ufl.edu/) (FINS), advised by [Dr. Damon Woodard](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/damon-woodard/). I am also leading my own research project through UF's [AI Scholars Program](https://ai.ufl.edu/for-our-students/meet-scholars/biography/erik-bloomquist.html), advised by [Dr. Catia Silva](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/people/faculty/catia-silva/).

Outside of research, I have served as an undergraduate teaching assistant for courses in [machine learning](https://www.ece.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/syllabi/Fall2024/EEE4773FundamentalsofML_Fall2024.pdf) and [circuits](https://eed.eng.ufl.edu/academics/courses/eel3003/). I'm also an avid musician and have performed with several groups, including the [UF Jazz Ensemble](https://www.ufjazz.com/) and [7 Degrees Brassband](https://www.7degreesbrassband.com/).

Upon graduation, I hope to pursue graduate studies in machine learning or a related field, where I can deepen my understanding of algorithmic foundations and work on challenging, high-impact problems.
